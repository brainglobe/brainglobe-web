### Introduction

The BrainGlobe Initiative was established by researchers at the 
[Sainsbury Wellcome Centre](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org) and the [
Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/).

We were developing software for the analysis and visualisation of neuroanatomical data 
(e.g. [cellfinder](https://brainglobe.info/cellfinder) and
[brainrender](https://docs.brainrender.info/)) when we realised that these tools were limited in their impact. 
Like the majority of tools in the field, they were limited to a single brain atlas in one species, and 
they weren't compatible or interoperable with any other software.

To solve this problem, we developed the [BrainGlobe Atlas API](https://brainglobe.info/atlas-api).
 This API  provides a common interface for programmers to download and process brain atlas data from multiple sources.
All BrainGlobe software is built around this API, which means that all the software is compatible, and can be used with 
different atlases, in different species.

### Future
In addition to developing our own software, we are working to build a community of neuroscientists and
 developers to leverage the vast data analysis ecosystem in Python for the analysis of neuroanatomical data.
