### Introduction
The core goal of BrainGlobe is to develop a suite of Python-based software tools for computational neuroanatomy. We developed several software packages to access, analyze and visualize anatomical data, by ensuring the interoperability of all of BrainGlobe's software we aim to facilitate the development of analysis pipelines and facilitate the process of going from raw data to publication-ready content. By producing a set of high-quality open-access Python packages we aim to accelerate the development of sophisticated analysis tools in python.
