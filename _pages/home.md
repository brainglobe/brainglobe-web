The BrainGlobe Initative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable 
Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy. 

We have three aims:
* Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs, 
  such as [cellfinder](https://brainglobe.info/cellfinder) and 
  [brainrender](https://docs.brainrender.info/).
  
* Develop core tools to facilitate others to build interoperable tools in Python, e.g. the
  [BrainGlobe Atlas API](https://brainglobe.info/atlas-api)

* Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage
with the scientific, and open-source community (e.g. by organising hackathons.)
